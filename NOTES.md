# perceptual mechanics — notes & punch list

This file is solely about the perceptualmechanics site — the live code, deployment, and content
sourcing that feeds into it. Reorganized 2026-07-16: everything about the two other writing
projects (The Secret World, A Manual of Perceptual Mechanics) moved into their own Scrivener
files, which are now the source of truth for that material going forward. See "project map"
below for where things live.

## project map (as of 2026-07-16)

- **perceptualmechanics** (this repo) — the live site + code. What lands here: finished scenes,
  scroll patches, wired-in content. Deploys to perceptualmechanics.com via manual `dist/` upload
  (see "deployment" below) — anything that shouldn't be public has no business in this repo.
- **A Manual of Perceptual Mechanics.scriv** (`/Users/scottcohen/Documents/A Manual of Perceptual
  Mechanics.scriv`) — a separate Scrivener writing project. Now the source of truth for that
  project, including a Research/"Archive Research Notes" document holding the general
  personal-writing-archive research history (previously duplicated here in NOTES.md).
- **The Secret World.scriv** (`/Users/scottcohen/Documents/The Secret World.scriv`) — a separate
  Scrivener writing project (the game/mythology-verse — Boston Scion, the Yankee Pantheon). Now
  the source of truth for that project, including a Research/"Boston Scion — Campaign Notes &
  Archive Search" document holding the campaign read and lost-spreadsheet-search history
  (previously duplicated here in NOTES.md).

Raw research/staging notes from archive deep-dives (the deep-dive write-ups, gem excerpts, campaign
reports) live outside all three of these, in `../perceptualmechanics-source-material/` — a sibling
directory to this repo, not tracked in git. See "housekeeping" near the bottom for why and when that
moved.

## nebula curator workflow
The curator tool runs **locally only** due to browser CORS restrictions on direct Anthropic API calls.

1. `npm run dev` in the project root
2. Open `http://localhost:5173/utils/nebula-curator.html`
3. Enter your Anthropic API key (from console.anthropic.com) — saves to localStorage
4. Paste URLs one at a time — Claude names each star and assigns a constellation
5. When you have enough stars, hit "rebuild constellations" for a full thematic remap
6. Hit "copy as JS" and paste the output into `src/scenes/nebula.js`
7. Commit and push — GitHub Actions deploys automatically

The live page at perceptualmechanics.com/utils/nebula-curator.html is password-protected
but non-functional for API calls. Use localhost instead.

## next up
- [ ] butterfly auto-rotate / camera sweep for YouTube Shorts (9:16 vertical)
- [ ] nebula: integrate curator tool output into nebula.js
- [ ] nebula: Webb/Hubble background image (bring a favorite)
- [ ] nebula: drawn constellation connections (hand-curated, not algorithmic)
- [ ] notebook review — new piece ideas

## pending decisions
- nebula star data — use curator tool to populate, then drop into nebula.js

## elements/cycle roster (reference — resolved 2026-07-16)

The elements/"cycle" scene this fed into is built and live (see "egg / leaf / cycle / nebula —
activated" below). Kept as its own section, not folded into history, since `cycle.js` references
this roster and research trail directly and may need it updated if a stream goes down for good.

- five-element live-stream piece (earth/water/air/fire/wood), embedded via the YouTube iframe API.
  Each stream carries a manual backup link rather than an automated "offline" detector — see the
  "egg / leaf / cycle" entry below for why. Roster as of 2026-07-16:

  | Element | Primary | Uptime | Backup(s) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Earth | [GlobalQuake](https://www.youtube.com/@GlobalQuake) — live seismic plot, auto-detects quakes worldwide | 24/7, always live | Force Thirteen Earthquakes, other seismic-monitor channels |
  | Water | [Smith River Cam](https://www.explore.org/livecams/zen-den/live-redwood-cam-1) (Explore.org, Jedediah Smith Redwoods SP) — wilderness river through old-growth redwoods, no development in frame | 24/7, always live | [Brooks Falls / Brooks River](https://explore.org/livecams/three-bears/brown-bear-salmon-cam-brooks-falls) (Katmai NP, AK) — bears fishing salmon, spectacular but solar-powered, goes dark in winter/low light |
  | Air | [YallBot](https://ryanhallyall.com/yallbot) — 24/7 AI weather broadcast, radar/storm analysis | 24/7, reliably live | Live Storm Chasers / Brandon Copic / Vince Waelti — only live during active severe weather, not steady |
  | Fire | [USGS Kilauea](https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/multimedia/webcams) — Cam A/B/C, thermal cams cover no-glow nights | 24/7, always live | Stromboli Volcano Live Webcam — "near-continuous" eruptions 1000+ yrs, effectively always-on; Mount Etna multi-cam (INGV); afarTV 4K/8K volcano streams |
  | Wood | Chattahoochee National Forest live cam — 24/7, real-time, no music | 24/7, always live | Panama Fruit Feeder / canopy cams (Explore.org) — more wildlife-focused |

  Reliable always-on picks: GlobalQuake (earth), Smith River (water), USGS Kilauea or Stromboli (fire),
  YallBot (air), Chattahoochee (wood). All five now have an always-live primary — no seasonal gaps.

- text-overlay source material for the elements scene (from archive/Writing archive, 2003-04 era,
  author: Scott Cohen — full research trail behind these picks now lives in A Manual of Perceptual
  Mechanics.scriv, Research/"Archive Research Notes"):
  - Fire → `Fire.doc`: word-association litany ("Fire. Burn. Sun. Light... The ash... Bunsen
    burner. Bonfire. Beach bonfire. Burning Man...") plus a longer two-part dialogue scene ending
    with a real wildfire visible from a party. Reserved for the fire stream's text overlay.
  - Water/Air/Earth/Wood → `Cartography.doc`'s "In The End It Falls Slowly Through The Aether": a
    single raindrop falling off a leaf, told through real physics (surface tension, friction,
    oxygen/nitrogen, root, sun) — touches water, air, earth, and wood in one continuous piece.
    This is the source text for the "leaf" scene (see "egg / leaf / cycle" below).

## full archive deep-dive (2026-07-16)

Did a complete pass on the entire `archives/Writing archive/` folder (228 files, ~1.84M words,
~2000–2025) hunting for site-usable material. Full write-up + the general findings (perceptual
mechanics' name origin, the fire-obsession stat, the L.A. Project, etc.) now live in A Manual of
Perceptual Mechanics.scriv, Research/"Archive Research Notes" — that project is the source of
truth for the archive-research history going forward.

What actually landed on the site from that pass: "The Crocodile Photograph" (dark-comedy short
story), "The Golden Hare" (one-sentence myth fragment, now the wandering interstitial), "The
Orrery of Los Feliz" (noir sci-fi vignette, now a clickable object in nebula.js) — see "gems wired
into the site" below.

## gems wired into the site (2026-07-16, same session)

- **The Crocodile Photograph** + **Fire.doc's two embedded stories** (dubbed `fireVigil` — the
  dying-man/Debbie dialogue about death and religion — and `fireCalamity` — the physics-rant/
  Edward-and-Maria party scene, wildfire visible in the middle distance) are now real patches on
  the scroll (`src/text/scrollTexts.js` + `src/scenes/manuscript.js`). Scroll is now ten pieces,
  not seven; Fire.doc's opening litany was deliberately left out of these two (still reserved for
  the elements/fire livestream project). Added a `tone-5` CSS tier for Crocodile Photograph since
  it's newer than everything previously on the scroll. `npx vite build` passes clean.
- **The Orrery of Los Feliz** is now a real object in `nebula.js` — a small clickable orrery (bronze
  center sphere, tilted orbit rings, three actually-orbiting bodies) sitting apart from the
  real-site constellations, opening the same info panel with the full found text. `nebula.js` is
  now active in `main.js` (see "egg / leaf / cycle / nebula — activated" below). Also worth
  flagging: `nebula.js` itself is way ahead of what the old "pending decisions" text used to
  describe (Webb-style clouds and hand-drawn constellation lines are already built, just built
  around real-site history instead of a curator-tool/astronomy concept) — that's now reflected
  above.
- **The Golden Hare** is a new top-level interstitial (`src/components/goldenHare.js`, wired into
  `main.js` via `initGoldenHare()`), not part of any single scene. Rare (roughly once every 1–3
  minutes), wanders across whatever's on screen — landing grid or an open experience, doesn't
  care which — as a plain inline-SVG silhouette, click reveals the one-sentence myth as a caption.
  Two variants (single scampering hare ~85%, a spinning Three Hares ring ~15%), redrawn from a
  real tattoo (Scott's own) and refined a second time against an Adobe Illustrator trace of the
  tattoo photo (see the file's header comment for detail on why that trace couldn't be used
  directly). Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` by not running at all rather than sitting inert.
- **Pygmalion** (a complete essay about an online catfishing episode) is wired into the scroll —
  slotted chronologically into the c. 2000 cluster. Scroll is now eleven pieces. Source essay's
  full context lives in A Manual of Perceptual Mechanics.scriv now, not here.

## egg / leaf / cycle / nebula — activated (2026-07-17)

Three pieces of new infrastructure (egg, leaf, cycle) were built 2026-07-16, `npx vite build`
verified, then deactivated the same day at Scott's request. `nebula.js` had been sitting
deactivated even longer ("being reworked"). All four were switched back on 2026-07-17: imports,
`SCENES` entries, nav icons, and preview tiles un-commented in `main.js` and `index.html`. Site
now has eight scenes live: sphere, butterfly, nebula, manuscript, theater, egg, leaf, cycle.
`npx vite build` verified clean after re-activation.

- **`egg.js`** — fully rebuilt. Retired the old "worldline" concept (Google Maps satellite tiles +
  a personal geographic path) in favor of a self-contained WebGL scene: Earth (a canvas-drawn
  texture, no network image fetch, same approach as nebula.js's cloud/halo textures), a dipole
  magnetic field traced as glowing arced lines, aurora curtains at both poles (gradient sprites,
  green fading to violet, swaying and flickering), and a scatter of small satellites on real
  tilted orbits (same pivot-rotation trick as the Orrery in `nebula.js`). Drag to orbit, same
  manual-drag pattern as `nebula.js`.
- **`leaf.js`** — new scene, built around "In The End It Falls Slowly Through The Aether" in full
  (Cartography.doc — see "elements/cycle roster" above). A single quiet vignette, not an explorable
  space: an orthographic-camera Three.js scene, a leaf shape holding a droplet through a slow
  34-second loop — surface-tension hold, freefall (with a few "escaped molecule" motes peeling off
  mid-fall), impact/splash, reform — with the text arriving caption-by-caption in the same order
  it was written, timed to the phase of the fall it describes.
- **`cycle.js`** — new scene, the five-element live-stream piece from "elements/cycle roster"
  above, actually built: real YouTube iframe embeds (not WebGL — DOM/iframe is the honest choice
  for actual documentary footage, same reasoning as `theater.js`), one button per element, a manual
  backup link per stream since YouTube gives no reliable cross-origin "stream is down" signal from
  inside an iframe. Fire.doc's word-association litany (the piece explicitly reserved for this
  since it was first found — see "elements/cycle roster" above) plays over the fire stream only, one
  phrase fading in at a time. Confirmed live YouTube channel/video IDs for all five streams via
  direct lookup (GlobalQuake channel `UCZmcd4cQ2H_ELWAuUdOMgRQ`, YallBot/Ryan Hall Y'all channel
  `UCJHAT3Uvv-g3I8H3GhHWV7w`, Kilauea Cam A `iws3rh5vLAQ`, the Explore.org Smith River cam
  `WUqQdNAUC1c`, Chattahoochee National Forest cam `mFB6KZnjhy0`) rather than guessing — worth a
  periodic check since livestream video IDs do occasionally change when a stream restarts.

## You've Got a Friend in Satan — scenes wired into the theater (2026-07-16)

Scott's first play (a 1996 scanned script) got a full verbatim Word-doc transcription
(`You've Got a Friend in Satan.docx`, Documents root) and eight curated scenes added to
`src/scenes/theater.js` alongside Truth and Beauty and Paul Revere: the Art/Horace "hot enough for
ya" routine, Horace's "Diving in Hamburg" monologue, the Never Have I Ever/Spam runner, the sales
pitch through Todd's seduction, Art's arrival as backup, Katie's "I will not break" speech, the
notary-stamp twist, and the closing reveal that the whole assignment was a setup. New characters
(Horace, Art, Satan, Voice of Satan, Katie, Todd, Aaron, Traci, The Woman) added to the shared
`CHARACTERS` map. Verified with a headless DOM mock driving 2000 forced clicks through the full
shuffled timeline (every scene, every beat), plus a clean `vite build`.

## housekeeping (2026-07-16)

`source-material/` (all the deep-dive write-ups, gem excerpts, and the Boston Scion campaign report)
moved out of this repo entirely, to `../perceptualmechanics-source-material/` — a sibling directory,
not tracked in git. Reasoning: it's working notes about *other* Scott projects (Secret World, the
Manual) and personal archive material, not site content, and had no business being in a public repo
or anywhere near what gets deployed. Added `source-material/` to `.gitignore` as a safeguard against
it landing back in by accident. Committed locally (`Move source-material/ out of the repo`) but not
yet pushed — **this repo is public on GitHub**, and the four files that were already tracked
(`archive-deep-dive.md`, `fire-excerpt-more-rambling.md`, `gem-crocodile-photograph.md`,
`gem-golden-hare-and-orrery.md`) are already live in its history from an earlier commit. Pushing the
new commit stops them showing at the tip of `main` going forward, but doesn't erase them from
history — that needs an explicit history rewrite (force-push), which hasn't been done and shouldn't
happen without Scott deciding that's worth it.
